API => APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE.



API - api makes communication between two computer possible.

Endpoint - endpoints are also called URL (uniform resource locator ). It is the end of a point .

URL => Uniform resource locator
URI => Uniform resource identifier

===== 
Two systems of programming are 

1. Synchronous programming 
2. Asynchronous programming 

    => Synchronous programming is a system of programming that follows a fixed set of sequence .

    => Asynchronous programming allows a user to go about his business in an application



========================

Axios and promises 

========================

---------> Axios is a promise based HTTP client for node js and browser . it makes it easy to send async request to endpoints . 
    Consumming of APIs can be done with and without axios. 
    CRUD => 
        create -> POST
        read -> GET
        update  -> Fetch 
        delete -> Delete



--------->  Promises is a special javascript object that serves an intermidiary between a producing code and a consuming code.
    promises takes in two parameters (resolve and reject).

JSON => Javascript Object Notation 




Whats HTTP -> (HyperText Transfer Protocol ). It is used to transfer data over the web . It is part of the internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for transmitting web-page data. HTTP uses a server-client model.

    ======== REQUESTS 
     1. Web request -> http that can only run on the web . e.g -> 

     2. Api request -> 



Whats API -> An API  is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another .

ANDROID 
IOS
IOT -> Internet Of Things

========== TYPES OF HTTP REQUESTS ================
1. Post  ->  Post requests are used to send data to the API server to create or update a resource. The data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the http request. 

2. Get  -> Get request are the most common and widely used meghods in APIs and websites. Simply put, the GET method is used to retrieve data from a server at the specified source. For example, say you have an API with a / users endpoint. Making a request to that endpoint should retun a list of all available users. 

3. Patch -> A patch request is a lesser know HTTP method. The difference with patch is that you only apply partial modifications to the resource . The difference between PATCH and PUT is that PATCH is request non-idemppotent(like a POST request).

4. Put -> Similar to POST, put requests are used to send data to the API to update or create a resource. The difference is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result.

5. Delete -> The DELETE method is exactly as it souncs: delete the resource at the specified URL. This method is one of the most common RESTful APIs so it's good to know how it works. +
